IMPORTANT MESSAGES
Refer to your Declarations Page and endorsements to verify that coverages, limits, deductibles and other
policy details are correct and meet your insurance needs. Required information forms are also enclosed
for your review.
1) USAA considers many factors when determining your premium. Maintaining your
property to reduce the probability of loss is one of the most important steps
you can take toward reducing premium increases. A history of claim activity will
affect your policy premium.
2) Go to usaa.com to view policy coverages and home features.
3) The USAA company that issues your policy has changed. This change will not affect
your coverage. Please review your policy packet and notices for information about
your change in membership eligibility.
4) If your home was built prior to 1941, you may have original finishes in the home
which could cost more to replace in the event of a loss. Please review the
Characteristics of Your Home flyer for accuracy. If any of the information is
incorrect, the rebuilding cost may be affected, so please revise any inaccuracies by:
* Logging on to usaa.com, selecting your policy and then Home Characteristics, or
* Calling us at 210-531-USAA (8722), our mobile shortcut #8722 or 800-531-8722.
5) The USAA company that issues your policy has changed, but rest assured, your
coverages remain the same, and you'll continue to receive our world-class service.
Please review your new policy to ensure it meets your current needs. If you have any
questions or want to make any changes to your policy, please call a member service
representative at 1-800-531-USAA (8722).
This is not a bill. Any premium charge or return for this policy will be reflected on your next regular
monthly statement.
To receive this document and others electronically or view your policy summary online, go
to usaa.com.
For U.S. Calls: Policy Service (800) 531-8111. Claims (800) 531-8222.

6) Your policy does NOT cover loss due to flood from any source. For information about
obtaining flood coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), call USAA
at (800) 531-8722, or contact the NFIP directly.
If you already have a flood policy, you should review it to make sure you have the
appropriate coverage and limits. No automatic increases or adjustments are applied to
your policy. Coverage for loss of household contents due to flood may be available at
an additional cost. If you have questions, please call a member service
representative at the phone number above.
7) Your policy now has a separate deductible for wind and hail coverage. This wind and
hail deductible is the same amount as the deductible for the other covered perils.
Other options are available for the Wind and Hail deductible amount as well as for
the other perils deductible. If you have questions, please call a member service
representative at (800)531-8722.
8) Your credit-based insurance score, or insurance score, was one of several factors
used in determining your policy premium. You have the right to request USAA to update
your insurance score once annually. In addition, you may request our written
statement describing our use of insurance scores by calling 1-800-531-USAA (8722).
